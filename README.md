# Haskell-MariaDB-Microservice 

Hi! This little repository contains a sample for connection a Haskell Commandline Executable from one Docker Container to a MariaDB in another Docker container.

It's the accompanying code to [my blogpost](https://twonki.github.io/haskell-microservice/) and shows the final state for copy and pasting.

## How to run

To understand everything step by step I recommend the blog, otherwise first build and run instructions for the database are in the [database folders README](./Database/README.md).
The general instructions how to start _everything_ are in the [checkers README](./Checker/README.md).
